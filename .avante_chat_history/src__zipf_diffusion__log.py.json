Here are the suggested changes:\n\nReplace lines: 4-19\n```python\ndef log_transform(noise: float, num_tokens: int, lower_bound: float = 8e-3) -> int:\n    if noise <= 0 or noise >= 1:\n        return 0\n    \n    normalized = (math.log10(noise) - math.log10(lower_bound)) / (-math.log10(lower_bound))\n    idx = int(normalized * (num_tokens - 1))\n    \n    return max(0, min(idx, num_tokens - 1))\n```\n\nThese changes simplify the function by:\n\n1. Combining the two initial conditions into a single if statement, reducing redundancy.\n2. Removing the unnecessary `x` variable and directly calculating the normalized value in one line.\n3. Removing the comments that were not adding significant value.\n\nThe function's logic remains the same, but it's now more concise and easier to read.", "request": "simplify"}]
